<p>This started with the goal of becoming my data science portfolio, when I was first looking for jobs.
I got the first few posts out, as a way to demonstrating the little bit of programming and optimization skills I had picked up in academia.  I landed my job at Enova before getting around to a serious ML project, and now all my ML projects are proprietary.</p>

<p>So now, this has changed targets a little.  The unfinished posts right now include cute math observations, a compilation of some of my datascience.stackexchange answers, and some trailing thoughts on my academic subjects.</p>
