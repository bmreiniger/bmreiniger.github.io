<p>I am a mathematics PhD turned data scientist.  Here I will post some data science work as well as some of the
 more programmatical work I did as an academic.</p>
<p>So far the posts here are just programming from academic research.  My first posts on other work will probably be on chess variants. I have access to data from the Chess Variant Pages and from Lichess, and want to do some exploratory analytics, maybe some graph theoretical computation (communities and the like), and hopefully use some machine learning to produce modified ELO scores for chess variants.</p>
<p>For more background and academic information, see (for now) 
 <a href="http://math.iit.edu/~breiniger/">my IIT site</a>.
