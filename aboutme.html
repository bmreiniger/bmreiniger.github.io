<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am originally from southwestern Illinois, a short distance from Saint Louis.  
I attended Southwestern Illinois College,
 Illinois State University,
 and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
I received my Ph.D. in mathematics in August 2015, with
 <a href="http://math.illinois.edu/~kostochk/">Alexandr&nbsp;Kostochka</a>
 as my advisor. 
At ISU I divided my time between pure mathematics and actuarial science,
 and had an actuarial internship with Country Financial before eventually
 deciding that I prefer pure math (research and teaching).
At the beginning of my time at UIUC, I considered research areas in
 algebra (especially categorical), topology, and geometric group theory
 before choosing combinatorics.  
I held a one-year postdoctoral fellowship at Ryerson University, with
 mentors <a href="http://math.ryerson.ca/~abonato">Anthony&nbsp;Bonato</a>
 and <a href="http://math.ryerson.ca/~pralat">Pawe&#322;&nbsp;Pra&#322;at</a>.
I am currently a visiting assistant professor at Illinois Tech.
</p>

<p>My wife has her degree in art, with a particular focus on puppetry.
 She has also spent several years working in early childhood development.
</p>

<p>I enjoy the outdoors, particularly in the fall.  I play tennis when I can. 
I was once very involved in theater and would like to pick 
that up again.  I have been brewing my own beer, wine, mead, and whatever 
else I can ferment since the summer of 2007; my brewing equipment 
steadily grows to take up more space.  I have a motorcycle, a Honda VTX.
  I enjoy chess and especially chess variants (see my Links page).
  I am a volunteer
 <a href="http://chessvariants.org/index/displayperson.php?personid=benr">editor</a>
 for <a href="http://chessvariants.org">The Chess Variant Pages</a>.
